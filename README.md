# Weather Dashboard

## Description

In this project, the user enters a city and can search for the weather by clicking the button. The current weather is displayed, along with the date, weather icon, wind speed, humidity, and UV index. By clicking on the 5-day forecast tab, the user can see the weather, weather icon, and humidity for the next five days.

A history of cities is collected for the session and allows the user to revisit the weather information simply by clicking on the city in the history. The history is only shown for the session and is not saved to local storage.

The last city that was displayed for the session is saved to local storage and is displayed when the user returns to the page.
